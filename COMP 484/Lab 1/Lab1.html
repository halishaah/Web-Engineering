            <p>Introduced in 1955 as the Coupe des Clubs Champions Européens, and commonly known as the European Cup,
                 it was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the champions of Europe's domestic leagues,
                  with its winner reckoned as the European club champion. The competition took on its current name in 1992,
                   adding a round-robin group stage in 1991 and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries since the 
                   1997–1998 season. It has since been expanded, and while most of Europe's national leagues can still only
                    enter their champion, the strongest leagues now provide up to four teams. Clubs that finish next-in-line 
                    in their national league, having not qualified for the Champions League, are eligible for the second-tier 
                    UEFA Europa League competition, and from 2021, teams not eligible for the UEFA Europa League will qualify
                     for a new third-tier competition called the UEFA Europa Conference League. </p>

            <p>The 2020 UEFA Champions League Final was the final match of the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 65th season
                 of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 28th season since it was renamed from 
                 the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. It was played on 23 August 2020 at the Estádio 
                 da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal, between French club Paris Saint-Germain, in their first European Cup final, and German
                  club Bayern Munich. The match was held behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. Bayern Munich 
                  won the final 1–0 thanks to a 59th-minute goal scored by former Paris Saint-Germain player Kingsley Coman, who was
                   later selected as man of the match. Bayern secured their sixth European Cup title and second continental treble,
                    becoming the second European men's football team to win the continental treble twice. </p>
