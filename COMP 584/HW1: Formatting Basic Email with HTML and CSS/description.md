- Unsure if your choice of html/css will work with email clients? ==> https://www.caniemail.com/ (Links to an external site.) 
- Again for this HW I'm only expecting purely structural html and css. No JavaScript functionality at the moment. 
- Majority of your css will be inline. No external css. 
- I added a screenshot of an example email one might send. Take note of the centering on certain areas. Location of screenshot is in the glitch assets area. 


## HW instruction:
Create a email page using HTML and CSS
  * Add some headings, some text, and an image to your basic email.
  * Make use of the div
  * You can use placeholder images and lorem ipsum text.
  * No web fonts for now.
  * Adjust the styles(inline) for the text in your email
  * Remember you will mostly use inline CSS no external linked sheet
