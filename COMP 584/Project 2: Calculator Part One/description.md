- Match your layout as close to the screenshot (located in assets) as possible using the CSS properties discussed and also researching MDN for new properties if needed. 
- Use the button element to represent each calculator button
- Make use of the special characters to show / , X, -, +, =
- In your HTML structure separate the calculator screen and buttons into separate sections.(This will help with the second part of this project)
- Keep the wrapper width that is set for you
- Make use of hover and active pseudo classes to show different states of button behavior. 
- Can use either flexbox or grid layout. Your choice.
